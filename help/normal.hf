NORMALIZE

	The NOrmalize command can be used by the main master (#0) to remove the
permissions of a user he or she has already made a master with the MTY
command (type EXP MTY).  The format is
        NO <user#>,<user#>,...
specifying the <user#>s of all the masters from whom you want to remove master
permissions.  Note that any users in subconferences of those who are normalized
will be returned to the main conference.
