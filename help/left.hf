LEFT

	The LEft command gives you a list of the most recent users to leave the
conference, and the time they left.  If the user was KIlled, a 'K' will
appear next to their time of departure.  If you type LE <number>, only that
many users will be listed; so, if you type
        LE 4
the last four users to leave the conference will be listed.
