This directory contains the help files for XCaliber Mark II.  The file
'exptoc.x' represents a compiled table-of-contents for the files here.
Xcaliber doesn't know about it if it's not here!

The script 'mktoc' will compile a text file into a binary
table-of-contents.  See the comments at the top of 'mktoc' for how
this works.  The uncompiled table of contents resides, for the moment,
in raw-toc.txt

The Xcaliber program looks in /usr/local/lib/xcal/help for these
files, by default.  You can make it look elsewhere by setting the
XCALHELPDIR environment variable before you run the program.  You know
the drill.
