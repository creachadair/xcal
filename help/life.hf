LIFE  (31 December 1979)

	Life is the property or quality manifested in functions such as
metabolism, growth, response to stimulation, and reproduction, by which
living organisms are distinguished from dead organisms or from inanimate
matter.

	Life is a monosyllabic morpheme consisting of a fronting dipthong
between a lateral liquid and a labio-dental voiceless fricative.

	Life is a bowl of cherries.
