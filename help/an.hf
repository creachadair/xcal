AN (Accept Notification)

	If you type AN, you will be told whenever someone joins or leaves the
conference.  An 'N' will appear next to your name in the WHO list (type E WHO)
to indicate that you're accepting notification.
	The opposite of AN is RN (Reject Notification).  When a user joins the
conference, they start out rejecting notification, since otherwise users on
slow terminals could be swamped with "New user" and "Ex-user" messages
immediately after signing on.
