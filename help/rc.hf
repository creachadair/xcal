RC (Reject Controls)

	The Reject Controls command prevents you from being sent control
(nonprinting) characters.  When you join the conference, you're
automatically rejecting controls, so the RC command is useful only after
you've used OC, which lets control characters through.
	When a user is rejecting controls, a "C" appears next to their name in
the WHO list.
