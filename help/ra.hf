RA (Reject Alls)

	Typing RA will prevent you from receiving tell-alls.  Note that you
won't even receive ones which are already being built when you type RA.
	The default when you sign on is accepting messages to all, except for
certain slow-speed ports, which are automatically RA when they join to
prevent the user from being flooded with messages just after joining.
	To undo an RA, type AA -- Accept Alls.
