MTY

	The MTY command allows the main master to create "master" terminals.  A
Master can have a subconference of his or her own if the main master (#0)
chooses to pass users to the "submaster."  To make someone a master, just
type
        MT <user#>,<user#>,...
giving the <user#>s of all the users you want to become masters.  To remove
someone's master permissions, the main master can use the NORmalize command
(type EXPLAIN NOR).
