DISABLE

	The DIsable command may be used by any master to prevent tell-alls
within his or her subcon.  Anyone who tries a tell-all will get the message
"Tell-all not enabled."

	Note that this command only affects a subconference: a sub-master may
use it.  The main master may disable tell-alls in the main conference.  To
reallow tell-alls in one's subconference, type ENable.
