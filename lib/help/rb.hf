RB (Reject Break)

	If you don't want to be disconnected from the conference by bumping your
'break' key, you can type RB and breaks will be completely ignored. The
opposite is AB (Accept Break).  This is also useful if you're dialing in
over bad phone lines which are generating breaks.
	Of course, the RB command does nothing for the main master (#0) since a
break on #0's terminal will always kill the conference.
