DW (Display Warning)

	The DW command tells you the current warning which the main master has
put on.  This warning was either on when you joined the conference or was
sent to you since then.  If there is no current warning, you will receive a
response of <cr><lf><lf><bel>, which can never be the actual warning (since
real warnings cannot contain "control" characters.)  For more information,
type E WARNING.
