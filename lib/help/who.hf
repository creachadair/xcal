WHO

      The WHO command prints a list of who is on the conference with you.  If
you type WHO, you'll get a list of the users, the number of each user, and
other information.  A sample WHO list might look like:
->[#0] M --- R  CN  Ronald Reagan
  [#1]   B-1   P    Gawan
  [#2] M R/M  I  N  Lanzilot
  [#3]   COM    CN  Ginover
  [#4]   R/I  X     Gahmuret, b
  [#5]   --- RB     Cundrie la sorciere
->                  means that this is the master receiving new users.
  [#n]              is the number of the user (for sending to them, etc.)
       M            means the user is a Master (type EX MTY)
         ---        is the user's state (type EX STATES)
             R      means they are Rejecting messages to all.
(Type    ->   I     means you're Ignoring that person.
 EXPLAIN ->   X           they're ignoring you.
 IGNORE) ->   B           you're both ignoring each other
               P    they're rejecting ports (type EX RP)
                C   they're rejecting "control" characters (type EX RC).
                 N  they're accepting notification of new users (type E AN).

Typing WHO in a subconference will list only the other members of the subcon.
