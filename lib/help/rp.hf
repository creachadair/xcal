RP (Reject Ports)

	The RP command prevents other users from finding your location with the
Port command (type E PORT).  Once you have typed RP, you can't port other
users, and you can't un-RP.
	If you want to be rejecting ports when you sign on, you may type RP
instead of your name; it will print "Rejecting ports" and ask for your name
again.
